# Experiment Assignment 2

**Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) and how you resolved**

The first day I worked with this assignment I had difficulties using EclipseLink and apache derby for unknown reasons. The day after I switched pc and tried the tutorial again
and had no difficulties doing the experiment 1.

This is a screenshot from when I managed to connect the database to Apache Derby

**Any pending issues with this assignment that you did not manage to solve**

I was not sure on what the task was in experiment 2 and did not get any reply when I sent a mail about it.
