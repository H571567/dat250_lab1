# Experiment Assignment 2

**Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) and how you resolved**

The first day I worked with this assignment I had difficulties using EclipseLink and apache derby for unknown reasons. The day after I switched pc and tried the tutorial again
and had no difficulties doing the experiment 1.

This is a screenshot from when I managed to connect the database to Apache Derby

**an explanation of how you inspected the database tables and what tables were created. For the latter, you may provide screenshots.**

After making the models I created a JPATest where I created the objects and persisted them. That way, it created the tables which you can see in the picture below.
