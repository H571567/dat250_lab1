# Experiment Assignment 2

**Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) and how you resolved**

The first day I worked with this assignment I had difficulties using EclipseLink and apache derby for unknown reasons. The day after I switched pc and tried the tutorial again
and had no difficulties doing the experiment 1.

This is a screenshot from when I managed to connect the database to Apache Derby
